"Magic Wand on mbed FRDM-K66F","https://github.com/hankhjliao/magic_wand_mbed","Spring 2020","C++, Python, TensorFlow, FRDM-K66F","Use FRDM-K66F as the magic wand. After waving the wand, the FRDM-K66F will recognize the gesture by the neural network and output the result. The original project only deploys to Arduino, Himax WE1 EVB, and SparkFun Edge. I deploy it to FRDM-K66F and make it more configurable."
"Deploy Style Transfer on the Android Devices","https://github.com/hankhjliao/deploy-style-transfer-on-android","Fall 2019","Python, Android Studio, Apache TVM","Use Apache TVM to deploy the style transfer model to Android devices."
"Image Encrypting and Decrypting","https://github.com/hankhjliao/10720EE366000","Spring 2019","Python, OpenCV, Qt5","Hide an image by adding its frequency transformation with the frequency transformation of another image during the JPG compression process. And I also implement the GUI to make it easy to use."
"Indoor Positioning","https://github.com/NTHUEE240500/Led\_Matrix\_Localization","Summer 2018","Python, OpenCV","Localize the robotic car using the led matrix with the bird-view camera. First, find the led matrix from the bird-view camera using own design algorithm. Second, decode the pattern of the led matrix. Third, show the pattern's meaning and the robotic car's location on the screen."
"Tracking Car","https://github.com/hankhjliao/tracking-car","Spring 2018","C++, Python, Qt 4, Xbee v1, FRDM-K64F","The robotic car will track the trace drawn on the ground and send the value of the magnetic field back to the PC. PC will show the path according to the magnetic field value on the GUI at the same time."
